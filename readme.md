## Notes:-

- **This is just basic chatbot, you can improve chatbot learning. Read¬†[documentation](https://rasa.com/docs/)**
- **Also the bangla word formation for this application is not yet complete. The library used here to  detect a begali word from a romanized bengali word is not giving a good accuracy.**
- **You can build a better chatbot by using the model by changing the dataset. You can use english or any other language for this purpose. Just need to change the intents and responses.**
